# API Scraping 🚀

**API Scraping** is an application developed in Python using **FastAPI**, **Selenium**, and **Docker** technologies. With this API, you can perform automations, scrape data, and create customized workflows for collecting and manipulating information directly from web pages.

This repository provides a scalable structure for building an API that performs scraping via HTTP requests. It is easily integrable into automation workflows, webhooks, and other services.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: The main language for development.
- **FastAPI**: A framework for building fast, modern, scalable, and simple APIs.
- **Selenium**: A browser automation tool used to interact with web pages.
- **Docker**: For packaging and running the environment in an isolated and consistent way.

---

## Features 🌟

- **Navigation Automation**: Full control over web pages using Selenium.
- **Data Collection**: Extract information from websites efficiently and at scale.
- **API Execution**: Define endpoints to start and control scraping and automation processes.
- **Webhooks**: Easy integration with other systems to trigger automated events.
- **Modular Structure**: Easily expand scraping logic by adding new scripts and endpoints.

## How to Run 🖥️

1. Ensure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
   ```
3. Start the Docker environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the application via a browser or tools like cURL/Postman:
   ```
   http://0.0.0.0:8000/
   ```

## Project Structure 📂

- **`main.py`**: Contains the main logic of the FastAPI application with defined endpoints.
- **`scraping.py`**: Example automation script using Selenium.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Configuration for running the Docker environment.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies for the application.
- **`tests/`**: (Optional) Suggested directory to add your automated tests.

---

## Usage Examples 🚀

- Start automations with Selenium through FastAPI endpoints.
- Execute customized tasks, such as extracting information from dynamic web pages.
- Integrate the API with other systems by consuming the exposed endpoints.
- Use the API as a base to create complex automation workflows.

💡 **Tip**: Be creative and adapt the structure to meet your scraping and automation needs!
